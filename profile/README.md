The [Center for Anytime Anywhere Analytics (CA3)](https://ca3.au.dk) conducts research in ubiquitous and immersive analytics (UA/IA) at the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.au.dk) at Aarhus University in Aarhus, Denmark.

We serve human advancement by enabling people to understand data through augmenting their physical and cognitive environments so that they can confirm the expected and discover the unexpected for the benefit of critical thinking and evidence-based decision making.
